# ABANDONED TRYING TO BUILD WITH COSMIC
# Whilst it is the only Ubuntu distribution on glibc 2.28, too many other packages are now no longer available.
# Instead we need to resort to installing an old version manually and then removing this for any apt operations.
# This is horrible, but, it works.

# RHEL 8.7 uses GLIBc 2.28
# Bionic uses libc 2.27 - but, the Qt binaries that download need 2.28
# The Python downloads to /opt and it is not checking that it runs.
# We will add a line to ensure this.
# Cosmic Cuttlefish is the only one on exactly 2.28
